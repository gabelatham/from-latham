### El Nopal
It is my favorite restaurant because I really enjoy Mexican food and it is one of the few places that is **not just fast food**. I also like the **variety** of food that they have compared to many of the fast food places that serve mostly only burgers. The food **portions** are also just the right size where you get completely full from 1 plate of food rather than being left wanting more.
