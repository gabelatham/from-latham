### El Nopal
It is my favorite restaurant because I really enjoy Mexican food and it is one of the few places that is **not just fast food**. I also like the **variety** of food that they have compared to many of the fast food places that serve mostly only burgers. The food **portions** are also just the right size where you get completely full from 1 plate of food rather than being left wanting more.

### Book/Song Recommendations
The below table includes mainly books but does include 1 song. The books are *Cop Town* which is my favorite book and then *The Call of the Wild* & *White Fang* which I really enjoyed back when I read them. The song I included is *Your House* by an artist named Hopsin. It is a song about his bad childhood and how it creates a cycle that he is going to end up following.
