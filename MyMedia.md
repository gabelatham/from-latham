### Favorite Book
I think that my favorite book is something called Cop Town. It is my favorite because it centers around a spree of cop killings where there are 3 main characters, one of which is the villain and serial killer. It's interesting because each chapters focuses on the life of one of the 3 characters and shows the story from their point of view and alternates evenly between them. For example I remember in one chapter it followed the female cop who was investigating one of the cop's deaths and then in the next chapter it focused on the villain who had a monologue talking about why he did it and how, all without every revealing his identity by only referring to him as "The Fox".
